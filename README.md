# elasticsearch-wordending-tokenfilter

Add a char to mark the end of each token. Useful in autocomplete search, used in
conjunction with edge-ngrams.

The tokenfilter has two modes: one for indexing, one for searching, the only
difference is that in searching mode the wordending char is not set on the
**last** word because we guess it's the beginning of the word being typed.

##Â Install

First, make sure `ES_HOME` is set. If not, export it, something like this:
```
export ES_HOME="/usr/share/elasticsearch"
```

Then, run the following commands after having cloned the repo:
```
make package
make install
```
